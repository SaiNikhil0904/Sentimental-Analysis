# Sentimental Analysis

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Sentimental Analysis project! This machine learning endeavor aims to analyze and predict sentiments expressed in textual data. The project utilizes various natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify sentiments as positive or negative. In-depth explorations include feature selection, data preparation, skewness handling, and model evaluation.

## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis and opinion mining on textual data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques, we aim to classify sentiments as positive or negative. The project's focus is to understand and analyze public opinions from various sources, such as social media platforms like Twitter.

## Project Impact
Understanding sentiments in text data holds immense potential, impacting areas such as:
- Marketing strategy formulation based on public sentiment.
- Enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Predicting and managing public reactions during events and campaigns.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection:** Utilizing TensorFlow, we downloaded Amazon review datasets to train our models.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Sentiment Detection:** Classification of sentiments into positive and negative categories.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementation of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for sequence processing.
